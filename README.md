Welcome to my app! The webapp can be run by ensuring you are in the right directory, then running flask run. When this is done, the webpage displayed should
be to register an account on the application. Having provided all the necessary information for the registration, you are now automatically logged in and the
page should redirect to the home page, which displays your personalised meal plan. From here, there are 4 possible options. Clicking Today's plan should always
redirect you to the home page, clicking Current Information will show you your current preferences as well as a calculated calorie goal, clicking Update Information
will allow you to change your information or preferences, and clicking Log Out will take you to a Log in page. The Website should be fairly straightforward to use as
much is explained in the actual website content.
